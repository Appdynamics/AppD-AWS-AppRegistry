# AppD-AWS-AppRegistry

Sample prototype of [AppDynamics](https://www.appdynamics.com) integration with [AWS AppRegistry](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/increase-application-visibility-governance-using-aws-service-catalog-appregistry/).  It can be used to pull the meta-data of one or more applications from an AppDynamics Controller and push it to the AppRegistry.
